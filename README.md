A simple command-line Hangman game implemented in Python. Players must guess the hidden word letter by letter, with a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is over.

## Features

- Displays blanks for the word and updates them as correct guesses are made.

- Ends with a win or loss message, revealing the hidden word if necessary.
